choco-solver version 4.10.10 or older is needed to use this SAC implementation, otherwise newer versions should be fine.

testLatinSquare(n,f,r,l) : generates and attempts to solve instances of size n*n pre-filled at f% until r instances are solved.
l is a node limit (l<=0 for no limit).

testLatinSquare2(n,f,r) : same operation but for the problem of latin squares with alldiffs on 2 rows/columns.

testKillerSudoku() : parses and solves the instances in the killerSudoku-16x16 folder.

Inside each function are two arrays 'tests' and 'Names'. The 'tests' array is used to define which resolution methods are used according to the numbering in the 'Names' array.

Each function then prints the average numbers of nodes and backtracks, and average resolution time of each method (counting solved instances only).
